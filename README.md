## 💡 Philosophy: Documentation as a Product

In an enterprise environment, documentation must be as scalable and resilient as the software it describes. I leverage **Docusaurus** not just as a static site generator, but as a robust framework to build versioned, searchable, and highly accessible documentation platforms that align with modern "Docs-as-Code" workflows.

## 🛠️ Technical Talent Stack

*   **Frameworks:** Docusaurus v2/v3, React-based componentization.
    
*   **Architecture:** Versioning (for EDR/XDR lifecycles), Internationalization (i18n), and Algolia Search integration.
    
*   **Tooling:** Node.js, npm/yarn, MDX (Markdown + React), and CSS-in-JS for custom branding.
    
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages, Vercel, and CI/CD automated build pipelines.

## 📐 My Documentation Standards

1.  **The Versioning Truth:** Documentation must match the user's specific product version (e.g., eScan v1.0 vs v2.0) to prevent configuration errors.
    
2.  **MDX Power:** I use React components within Markdown to create interactive "Pro-tips," "Security Warnings," and "Policy Checklists."
    
3.  **Search-First Design:** If a security admin can't find an incident response step in 3 seconds, the documentation has failed.
